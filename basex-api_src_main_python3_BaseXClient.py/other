"\nPython 2.7.3 and 3.x client for BaseX.\nWorks with BaseX 7.0 and later\n\nRequires Python 3.x or Python 2.x having some backports like bytearray.\n(I've tested Python 3.2.3, and Python 2.7.3 on Fedora 16 linux x86_64.)\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n\n* binary content would corrupt, maybe. (I didn't test it)\n* also, will fail to extract stored binary content, maybe.\n  (both my code, and original don't care escaped 0xff.)\n\nDocumentation: http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Clients\n\n(C) 2012, Hiroaki Itoh.
