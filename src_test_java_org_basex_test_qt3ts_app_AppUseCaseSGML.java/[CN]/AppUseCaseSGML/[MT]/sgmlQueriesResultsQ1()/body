The\n traditional meaning of markup is the manual <emph>marking</emph> up\n of typewritten text to give instructions for a typesetter or\n compositor about how to fit the text on a page and what typefaces to\n use. This kind of markup is known as <emph>procedural markup</emph>.</para><para>Most electronic publishing systems today use some form of\n procedural markup. Procedural markup codes are good for one\n presentation of the information.</para><para>Generic markup (also known as descriptive markup) describes the\n <emph>purpose</emph> of the text in a document. A basic concept of\n generic markup is that the content of a document must be separate from\n the style. Generic markup allows for multiple presentations of the\n information.</para><para>Industries involved in technical documentation increasingly\n prefer generic over procedural markup schemes. When a company changes\n software or hardware systems, enormous data translation tasks arise,\n often resulting in errors.</para><para>SGML defines a strict markup scheme with a syntax for defining\n document data elements and an overall framework for marking up\n documents.</para><para>SGML can describe and create documents that are not dependent on\n any hardware, software, formatter, or operating system. Since SGML documents\n conform to an international standard, they are portable.</para><para>You can break a typical document into three layers: structure,\n content, and style. SGML works by separating these three aspects and\n deals mainly with the relationship between structure and content.</para><para>At the heart of an SGML application is a file called the DTD, or\n Document Type Definition. The DTD sets up the structure of a document,\n much like a database schema describes the types of information it\n handles.</para><para>A database schema also defines the relationships between the\n various types of data. Similarly, a DTD specifies <emph>rules</emph>\n to help ensure documents have a consistent, logical structure.</para><para>Content is the information itself. The method for identifying\n the information and its meaning within this framework is called\n <emph>tagging</emph>. Tagging must\n conform to the rules established in the DTD (see <xref xrefid=\"top4\"/>).</para><para>SGML does not standardize style or other processing methods for\n information stored in SGML.</para><para>The Graphic Communications Association has been\n instrumental in the development of SGML.
